## Overview

**One Trick** connects to the League Client, fills enemy picks in champion select, recommends items and runes for your profile, exports loadouts into the client, and keeps a dual-rail chrome overlay alive while you play.

Profiles: **Pyke Support**, **Pantheon Support**, **Yone Mid**.

---

## Features

### Matchup & loadout

- **Enemy composition analysis** by role
- **Profile builds** — core path first, then boots, then situational (boots are not forced to the front of the checklist)
- **Rune pages** adapted to poke, CC, and lane shape
- **Dominance gauge** for how favorable the setup is
- **Loading-screen doctrine** — exact how-to-play lines for the matchup so you can leave the companion UI and focus on macro
- **Ally context** — ADC / Mid / Jungle when the draft asks

### League Client integration

- Auto-connects when the League Client is running
- Fills enemies as champ select locks in
- **Export runes** and **item sets** with one action
- Clears cleanly after the match for the next lobby

### In-game overlay

- Dual-rail HUD: enemy summoners on the left, cues / buy / vision on the right
- **Gank probability square** — yellow = fog / low-vision risk; red = brief high window from per-jungler pathing
- **Purpose-first wards** — what the ward is for, pink count, sweep targets when Oracle / Control Ward is held (pots first early — no pink on the open)
- **Pro-level tips** and roam / cannon windows (no basic filler)
- Transparent chrome around ability bar and minimap; **Sync LoL** reads Interface scales from `game.cfg`
- Stays visible mid-match — click-through healed, soft LCU flaps do not tear it down

### Summoner timers

- Tracks enemy bot (ADC + Support) or mid Flash / combat sums from Live Client + kill events
- **PageUp / PageDown** toggle Flash (press again to clear) via a **Windows low-level keyboard hook** so keys work while League has focus
- Numpad **9** / **3** fallbacks
- Mid: PageUp = Mid Flash, PageDown = Ignite / TP / Flash fallback

---

## Install (Windows)

### From a release (recommended)

1. Open [**v1.0.0**](https://github.com/developer-az/One-Trick-Client/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
2. Download **`One.Trick.Setup.1.0.0.exe`**
3. Launch with the League Client open (or start League afterward — it reconnects)

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/developer-az/One-Trick-Client.git
cd One-Trick-Client
npm install
npm run dist
```

Builds land in `release/`.

---

## Quick start

1. Start **League of Legends**, then open **One Trick**
2. Lock in on a supported profile (Pyke / Pantheon / Yone)
3. Review **items**, **runes**, and **matchup doctrine**
4. Click **Export** to push into the client
5. Overlay appears when the match starts (Borderless display mode)

Manual enemy picks still work when LCU is unavailable (Demo mode).

---

## Overlay controls

| Action | Shortcut / control |
|--------|--------------------|
| Toggle primary Flash (ADC or Mid) | **PageUp** or **Numpad 9** |
| Toggle Support Flash / Mid Ignite·TP | **PageDown** or **Numpad 3** |
| Show / hide overlay | **Ctrl+Shift+H** |
| Lock (click-through) / unlock panel | **Ctrl+Shift+U** |
| Align HUD / minimap frames | Unlock → **Align** → nudge Ability / Map |
| Match League scales | **Sync LoL** or HUD / Map sliders |

### Display mode (FPS)

Set League **Video → Display Mode** to **Borderless**. Exclusive Fullscreen forces expensive recomposition under an always-on-top overlay.

### Hotkeys while League has focus

PageUp / PageDown use a system keyboard hook (`uiohook-napi`), not Electron’s accelerator registry alone.

If keys still do nothing: **run One Trick as Administrator** whenever League is elevated — Windows UIPI blocks hooks across that privilege gap.

---

## Usage notes

- **LCU** — Client must be running for champ-select fill and export
- **Live Client** — Overlay and summoner heuristics need an active match
- **Data** — Champions / items / runes from Riot Data Dragon
